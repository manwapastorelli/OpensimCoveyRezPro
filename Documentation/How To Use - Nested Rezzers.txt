How To Use - Nested Rezzers
====================

What are nested rezzers? It is the process of taking a rez box packed with items, then placing that rez box inside another rezzer which will rez out that rezzer.

It is easiest to picture as a pyramid of rezzers with a parent child relationship. 

At the top of the pile is your parent rez system. 

                                                                        Parent
                                                                    
                                       Child Level 1                                                         Child Level 1
                                         
                    Child Level 2                   Child Level 2                   Child Level 2                    Child Level 2
                          
               Item     Item    Item          Item    Item    Item          Item    Item    Item            Item    Item    Item

The parent rezzes the Level 1 Children. Then each of the level 1 children in turns rezzes more, either more rez systems or actual items. You can take this as deep as you wish to go. 

The basic process for this is exactly the same as packing any other rez system just done in a specific order level in the tree, the items and pack them into the rez box's at the first level in the tree. 

Stage 1, pack the items into each of the level 1 rez box's. 

Stage 2, put item scripts into each of the rezzers which is next up the tree. Take them to your inventory and pack them into the relevant boxes on the next level up the tree. 

Stage 3. Keep following this process until you only have one rez box left as the parent rezzer. 

This process is mostly aimed towards the API. So you can automate what to rez, where to move each box, and which items, or sets to rez from which box.
