Manual Pick-up Vs Auto Pick-up - Why you might use both
======================================

The Auto pick-up mode is designed to make life quicker and easier when packing a Rez System. As soon as you drop the script into your item it automatically appears in your inventory ready to drop copy into the Rez Systems contents.  Using this mode makes it very easy to see what you have recorded. Simply put, if the item is on the sim then you have not recorded it. 

Like most things which are convenient there are some costs. Due to a bug in the Open Sim server software anything recorded this way will have a fake phantom status applied to it. The Covey Rez System pro allows for this and corrects it. If you are going to rez the items a small number of times the extra processing power used to apply that fix is minimal.  If however you are going to use the system in a place where they are rezzed over and over you should consider using a manual pick-up method or re-recording the items afterwards.

There are two other cases where you may wish to use manual pick-up:
The first is in regions where you do not have the rights to use the osForceAttach function. 
The second is if you wish to pack your objects as coalesced items rather than individual items. This could be useful if you know you will always rez then as a set.  One big reason for this would be script load. If you rez a Rez Set with 300 individual items in the script has 300 rez operations to carry out. If you rezzed a single coalesced item which contained 300 items the script has just one job to do.
