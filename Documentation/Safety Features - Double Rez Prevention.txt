Safety Features - Double Rez Prevention
===========================

Only applies when using "Rez All", it does not apply to rezzing of Sets or Single items. 

If you attempt to rez items while already having items rezzed the system will refuse to rez again. This prevents multiple copies of the same item occupying the same space. 

If you somehow end up in a situation where nothing is rezzed but the system thinks there is (such as you manually deleting items, or you removing them all through Sets) simply use the de-rez all button and then rez again.
