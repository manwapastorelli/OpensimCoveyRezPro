Safety Features - Fake Phantom Protection
============================
Video Demonstration: https://youtu.be/aBcrnJBTo_A

OpenSim has a bug which will sometimes cause items to act as though they are phantom even when their status is not set to phantom. This happens more frequently with items which were previously attached to an avatar. 

This bug also seams to happen more frequently if many items are being rezzed in a short space of time.

If you find items like this, you can fix them by setting their status to phantom and then back again.

This is exactly what the Covey Rez Pro system does. It checks the phantom status on all objects being rezzed. If its not supposed to be phantom it will set that item to phantom and then solid again. 

The effect is that items rezzed by the Covey Rez Pro system do not demonstrate the bug.
