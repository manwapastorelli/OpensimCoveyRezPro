How To Get Around The Underground Rezzing Bug
- Logan Stargazer

There is a serious bug in Open Sim that can easily cause severe damage to your region should you use the underground rezzing option in Covey rezzer. Sometimes you need to have objects partially underground though.
Examples would be rocks, lumps of soil, baseplates or some lower part of an object that you just don't want to be visible. This can be fixed in a way. 

The key point is that the ROOT PRIM of an object may not be underground. The child prims don't matter. The way this can be fixed is by creating a new root prim. This is simple.

1) Rez a new prim and resize it rather small. A sphere will work fine.
2) Position this prim a meter or so above the trouble-making object about centre of it.
3) Rename the new prim to whatever the objects name is and add something like "Fixed for rezzer".
4) Edit the object, hold down shift, then select the new sphere then choose "Link".
5) The sphere will be the new root prim of the object.
6) Edit the object and click the "Edit Linked Prim's" box.
7) Select the sphere (The new root prim) and making sure it's the only link selected.
8) Go to the texture tab and change the transparency to 100.

Your object now has a new root prim above it and the visible part can be moved as much underground if you wish. 

Those 8 steps are much simpler than they look.
