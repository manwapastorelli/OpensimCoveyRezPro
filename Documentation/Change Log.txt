Added chat feed back giving the user the previous rotation of the box if its auto fixed for recording.

Bug Fix: Turning on recording now also turns on required listeners. Turning off recording before stopped the items listener and it wasn't turned back on. 
Checks made on rez box rotation when recording is enabled, if box is not at <0,0,0> a warning is sent and an option to automatically fix this offered.

Features

Added ability to show rez box info in hover text
add api commands and feedback for hovertext
add api commands and feedback for chat feedback options

Various efficiency improvements to the control script:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

RegionSayTo messages to items now go through the same method for consistency
Some global variables removed and added to method parameters or local variables 
All listeners turned off unless strictly needed (except the menu listener).
All set object descriptions calls done through one method for consistency
Checks to make sure items exist when rezzing attempted added
Massive improvement in dynamic menu memory usage

Various efficiency improvements to the items script:
----------------------------------------------------------------
changed the name of the settings note card to begin with a dot. So it shows at the top of the inventory.
Many global variables removed and added to method parameters or local variables 
notecard reading changed from data server to ossl 

3.2
==
Changes to items and box control script.
Unless box recording is enabled the menu to update the item position on the items is now disabled.
Clicking it without recording being enabled would do nothing anyway and this improves performance by turning off a listener.  
Additionally it prevents the update position menu interfering with normal operation of rezed items which respond to mouse clicks. 
updated the heard message in box to box communications to match the changes above

3.0
==
