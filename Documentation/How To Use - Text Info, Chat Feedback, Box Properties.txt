 
How To Use - Text Info, Chat Feedback, Box Properties
=====================================
The status of almost all settings can be displayed in hover text..

To access hover text display go to the "InfoDisplay" menu

"TextSetting" - turns on hover text display of the current settings
"TextContent - turns on hover text display showing a summer of the systems contents
"TextOff" - turns off the hover text display. 

In the same menu you can also disable Chat Feedback by clicking "ChatOff". It can be enabled again by clicking "Chat Off". It is strongly recommended that you do not turn chat feedback off until you are 100% sure this is a working system and only then if you need to. If you turn this off you will not be able to see any errors. 

It is useful however if your in a situation where the system is being used by sim users in general via the api and you as the owner to not want constant messages telling you someone did something. 

The last two settings in here are again usually used via the ap and are for situations where the Rez system is part of a larger project. The rezzing object can be made invisible by clicking "AlphaOn" and visible again by clicking "AlphaOff". 

The same principle applies to phantom on and off, making it so that the rezzor does not get in the way of avatars or moving objects, everything will just pass through it as if its not there.
