Safety Features - Rez Limit Protection
=========================

Covey Rez Pro comes with a host of features to make your life easier and to help you avoid loosing items or just going "arrrrggghhhh". One of these features in rez limits protection. 

If you push an item outside the boundaries of the sim with a script they will simply vanish. While this is not a huge problem with a rezzer it is annoying. Especially if you want to rez near the edge of a sim and then rotate. The Covey Rez Pro fixes this issue for you. 

Each time an item is rezzed it will check the size of the region it is rezzed on. Then if an item tries to move to a position outside the boundaries of the region it will send an error to the user and refuse to move. The same applies to attempting to move items above 10 km high or below ground (unless you enable underground movement),

If you then move the rez box in such a way the items are no longer trying to move outside the boundaries of  the region they will then return to the same position relative to the box they always have been. 

A word of caution: 

Due to another open sim issue the Covey Rez Pro doesn't try to move an item into position just once. If it doesn't succeed the first time it will try, try and try again. This was necessary to avoid items unexpectedly not moving.  However it also means if you try and move items Off Sim, the system will keep trying to move them time and time again. With a small number of items this will not be a problem. However if you tried to move thousands of items off sim you could find that the server simply doesn't respond to some items. Even if it doesn't until you move the rezzer to a position where it is not trying to place items off sim this will put an unnecessary load on the sim. 

If you get sim limit errors in relative mode move/rotate the rez system until it is not happening. If you get them in absolute mode de-rez the items. In absolute mode items are returned to their original position. So the only way this should be possible is if you record items on a Var region which is larger than the one you are attempting to rez on. Unless it is due to items trying to move under ground. In which case see the notecard about underground rezzing and try again.
