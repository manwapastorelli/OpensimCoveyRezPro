How To Use - Placing Builds Permanently

===========================

The Covey Rez Pro system will do far more than act as a normal rez box. However it will still do exactly that. If you wish to leave something out permanently all you need to do is "Finalise" the items. 

Simply rez your items, move and rotate the rez box until its in a situation your happy with. Then on the main menu click the "Finalise" button. This will remove all Covey Rez Pro scripts and settings cards from the items.
