Once there you should see a large vendor in one of the units surrounding the central landing point. 

You have two options for getting the system, you can either click "Donate" and make a donation or you can click "Free" and the item will be delivered to you for free. 

Please note, paying the vendor 0 will not work. As with all scripted vendors payments of 0 are not picked up. Its why all scripted vendors giving freebie either have you pay 1 and refund it or have a separate free button.
