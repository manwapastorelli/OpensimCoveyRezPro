How To Use - Rezzing Items (Basic Usage)
============================

These instructions start from Point you have successfully packed a rez system with some items. If you have not please follow the notecard:
How To use  - Creating A Rez System (packing items)

1. Drag your packed rez system from your inventory onto your land. 
You will see a notice in local chat advising you that recording has been disabled. 

2. Click the rez system 

3. Click on Rez Mode and choose either Absolute or Relative. 
Relative positioning will rez your items in relation to the position of the rez system allowing you to move them around and rotate them.
Absolute positioning will return the items to their original position and rotation on the sim you packed them on. 
Most Rez box systems use relative positioning so if this is what you're looking for use Relative. 

4. Click on the Main Menu button

5. Click on Rez/DeRez

6. Click on RezAll

7. Assuming you chose relative mode, if you now move the Rez system around or rotate it your items will  move with it. 

Now you can either de-rez your items ready to rez again later. Or if you wish to leave them in this place permanently go back to the Main Menu and then click Finalise. That will remove the settings cards and Covey Rez system scripts from your items. 

NB. If you wish to leave the Rez system out with items rezzed so that people can interact with the items while rezzed it is strongly recommended that you follow the next two steps.  

8. Click on the Main Menu button then Rez Mode button

9. Choose Absolute.  When you come to rez the items again you just need to turn relative mode back on from the same place. If this Rez system is going to be a permanent fixture on your SIM you should read some of the more advanced documentation regarding the use of Absolute Positioning, re-recording and the A.P.I.
