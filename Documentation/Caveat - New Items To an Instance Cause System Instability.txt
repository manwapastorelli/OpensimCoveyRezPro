Caveat - New Items To an Open Sim Instance Cause System Instability
==============================================

This is usually only seen when a region already has performance issues. 

Occasionally if you are rezzing objects which have never been used on an OpenSim instance and you try to rez items which require a lot of system resources the whole region will simply grind to a halt. 

There are two ways of avoiding this. The first is by slowing down the first rez by using Rez Sets.  Create a rez set which contains all the items in the Rezzer then rez the set instead of using Rez All. This will dramatically slow the rezzing process down and avoid the issues.  The second way is to simply restart the region after the rez which has cause issues. It will then be functioning exactly as you expect, and in each case i have seen so far all items will be rezzed. 

Once the items have been successfully rezzed on an instance this does not happen. If it happens once i suggest a region restart and then rezzing the items using the rez set method above to get a full successful rez.
