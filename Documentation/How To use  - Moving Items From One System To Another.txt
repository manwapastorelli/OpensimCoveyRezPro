How To use  - Moving Items From One System To Another
======================================

In most cases moving items from one Rez system to another is as simple as opening the contents tab on one, copying the item from there into your inventory and then copying them again into the new rez system.

There are certain cases however when this may not work. Usually because people have picked up items a second time after they have been rezzed and placed that copy into the contents. However if your combining rez systems into a larger collection you may also wish to convert the entire set into a collessed object to save server resources. 

In either case you can use the PrepBoxExch button found in the PosRecMenu.

Rez the items, click PrepBoxExchange

Then pick up the items as individual objects or collessed objects then drop them into the new system.
