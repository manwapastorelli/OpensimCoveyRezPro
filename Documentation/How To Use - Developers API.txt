How To Use - Developers A.P.I.
====================
There are two methods of using the API - llRegionSay or llMessageLinked

Inbound API:
---------------
link_message:  mum = rezBoxSetNumber
llRegionSay: channel = rezBoxSetNumber
When communication is inbound the instruction is telling the API which method to call and the data is giving the method specific information it needs

ProcessApiMessage(string message)
{   //process the api message and acts on the instruction
    // string arrives in the format "instruction,data"
    list instructions = llCSV2List(message);
    string instruction = llList2String(instructions,0);
    string data = llList2String(instructions,1);
}

Outbound API
----------------
llMessageLinked: num = -1* rezBoxSetNumber
llRegionSay: channel = -1*rezBoxSetNumber
When communication is outbound the "instruction" is telling API which method was just used and "data" what specific instructions the method used. 
Outbound linked messages are sent to all prims except the one the main rez box scripts are in. 

MessageFeedback(string instruction, string data)
{
    string toSend = instruction + "," + data;
    if (apiLinkedMessage) llMessageLinked( LINK_SET, !rezBoxSetNo, toSend, "" );
    if (apiRegionSay) llRegionSay(!rezBoxSetNo, toSend);
    if (chatFeedback) llOwnerSay(instruction + ": " + data);
}

Api General
---------------
If the Rez Box Set Number (rezBoxSetNumber) is -987654321 then  the outbound channel number is 987654321. 
The rez box set number can be found by using the menu or looking at the first number in the object description of the rez box. 

Everything you can do through the main menu can be done via the api as well as a few extras which can not be done via the menu. 

Both API methods can be enabled and disabled individually. They can also be turned off via the API commands. So take care, as if your not careful you can turn the API off via the API. That would mean you had to turn it back on via the menu. 

All inbound and outbound messages through the API follow the same format. One string which is a comma separated value. The first half is the instruction and the second part is the data.  eg. "instruction,data". The code snippet below is how the script will process the string you send.
